### Prerequisites

Before installing and running this project on your local machine, make sure you have installed the following :

- Java (OpenJDK version 16.0.1)
- Maven
- Java IDE (I recommend [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/))

If you are using Intellij, maven is already integrated in the IDE and you can easily download the right Java SDK from your project settings.
